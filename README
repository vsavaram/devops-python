# Devops-python

This is a simple python program that handles user inventory.
There exists two interfaces: 
 - Register new users 
 - Login and retrieve user information. 

## Getting Started

To run this project, all you need in python v3, and a decent IDE such as PyCharm to read/modify/execute the code. 

### Prerequisites
You will need to create a database file named users.txt with the required columns created.
project.py requires the users.txt to have the following header before trying to execute it.
```
Username | Password | Full name | Phone number
```

### Registering new users
When project.py is executed, input (y) to the prompt that asks if a new user should be registered.
For e.g. this is how the output will look when a new user is registered.
```
Do you want to register a new user??(y/n)y
Username:vamsi
Password:vamsi234
Fullname:Vamsikrishna Savaram
Phone number:075634123

User vamsi registered successfully
Full name: Vamsikrishna Savaram
Phone number: 075634123
```

### Logging in of an user
When project.py is executed, input (n) when prompted to register a new user, and input (y) when prompted for login.
For e.g. this is how the output will look when the login succeeded.
```
Do you want to register a new user??(y/n)n
Do you want to login??(y/n)y
Username:vamsi
Password:vamsi1234

Logged in successfully
Full name: Vamsi Blah
Phone number: 0201234567

For e.g. this is how the output will look when the login failed.
```

Do you want to login??(y/n)y
